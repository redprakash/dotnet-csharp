# Project objective:
  - Create a simple application that allows login if username and password match
  - If not then asks to enter again indefinitely
  - When logged in successfully, it asks for all profile like attributes (.e. dob, first name, last name, mobile, address etc.)
  - Keeps it in the memory
  - And prints all information gathered after last info is collected.
